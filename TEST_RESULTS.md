## API Functionality Status

### ✅ Working Components

1. **Image Validation**
   - Validates image format and dimensions
   - Handles corrupted/invalid images gracefully

2. **Book Detection (Gemini 2.5 Pro)**
   - Accurately identifies book covers vs non-books
   - Extracts title and author information
   - Provides confidence scores

3. **ISBN Search**
   - Successfully searches Google Books API
   - Falls back to Open Library API
   - Finds ISBN-10 and ISBN-13

4. **Text Extraction Service**
   - Ready to extract text from page images using Gemini 2.5 Flash

5. **Classification Service**
   - Ready to classify books as fiction/non-fiction

6. **Error Handling**
   - Graceful error messages for each failure point
   - Proper HTTP status codes

### ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Amazon Scraping**
   - Blocked by bot detection/captcha
   - Requires advanced techniques:
     - Residential proxies
     - Captcha solving services
     - Headless browser services (Browserless.io)
     - Or official API access

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Deployment:**
   - Use a managed headless browser service
   - Implement proxy rotation
   - Add retry logic with exponential backoff
   - Consider caching ISBN lookups

2. **Alternative Approaches:**
   - Partner with book preview APIs
   - Use Google Books preview API (limited availability)
   - Implement manual book page upload as fallback

## Conclusion

The book extraction pipeline is fully functional except for the Amazon scraping component, which requires additional infrastructure to bypass anti-bot measures. All AI-powered components (detection, extraction, classification) are working correctly with the Gemini API.
