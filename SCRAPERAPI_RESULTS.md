# ScraperAPI Test Results

## Summary

ScraperAPI successfully connected and scraped Amazon pages, but encountered challenges with Amazon's Look Inside feature:

1. ✅ **ScraperAPI Connection**: Working correctly
2. ✅ **Amazon Page Access**: Successfully accessed book pages
3. ❌ **Look Inside Extraction**: No preview images found in HTML
4. ❌ **Generic URL Access**: Amazon blocks direct image URLs (400/500 errors)

## Why This Happens

Amazon's Look Inside feature:
- Loads dynamically via JavaScript after page load
- Uses complex iframe structures
- Requires authentication tokens for image access
- Images are protected by CloudFront with signed URLs

## Alternative Solutions

### 1. **Use Google Books API** (Recommended)
Many books have preview pages available through Google Books:
```javascript
// Example: https://www.googleapis.com/books/v1/volumes?q=isbn:9781476755830
```

### 2. **Manual Upload Option**
Let users upload the book pages themselves as a fallback

### 3. **Partner APIs**
- HarperCollins has an API for their books
- Some publishers provide preview APIs
- Library services like OverDrive have APIs

### 4. **Advanced ScraperAPI Features**
- Use `wait_until: 'domcontentloaded'`
- Add custom JavaScript execution
- Use session management for multi-step scraping

## Conclusion

While ScraperAPI works well for general web scraping, Amazon's Look Inside feature requires more sophisticated approaches due to its anti-scraping measures. The most reliable solution would be to use official book preview APIs or allow manual page uploads.
